# Feature Specification: Weekly Task Management Web App

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-web`  
**Created**: September 10, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a web app for managing weekly tasks with a calendar-like interface, featuring daily columns (Sunday-Thursday) and draggable todo items with markdown descriptions stored in localStorage"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user working on a Sunday-Thursday schedule (Israel work week), I want to organize my tasks in a calendar-like view so that I can easily manage and track my work throughout the week. I want to be able to add, edit, move, and mark tasks as complete, with the ability to add detailed descriptions using markdown formatting.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the main page, **When** I view the interface, **Then** I see 5 columns (Sunday-Thursday) for the current week with today's column highlighted
2. **Given** I am viewing the task board, **When** I double-click a task, **Then** a modal opens showing the task title and markdown description editor
3. **Given** I am viewing tasks, **When** I drag a task from one column to another, **Then** the task moves and the change persists in localStorage
4. **Given** I am viewing the current week, **When** I click navigation buttons, **Then** I can move to previous/next weeks or return to current week
5. **Given** I have tasks in various states, **When** I refresh the page, **Then** all task data is preserved from localStorage

### Edge Cases
- What happens when localStorage is full?
- How does the system handle invalid markdown input?
- What happens when dragging a task while the modal is open?
- How does the system handle very long task titles or descriptions?
- What happens when accessing from a different timezone?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display 5 columns representing Sunday through Thursday
- **FR-002**: System MUST highlight today's column visually
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow adding new tasks to any column
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a general tasks column on the left side for date-independent tasks
- **FR-005**: System MUST save all changes to localStorage automatically
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow tasks to be marked as complete via checkbox
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow tasks to be deleted
- **FR-008**: System MUST support drag-and-drop reordering of tasks within and between columns
- **FR-009**: System MUST display a modal with title and markdown editor on double-click of any task
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide week navigation (previous/next/today) buttons above the columns
- **FR-011**: System MUST display the date and weekday name at the top of each column
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist task order within columns
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate and sanitize markdown input for security

### Key Entities
- **Task**: Represents a todo item (title, description, completion status, column assignment, order index)
- **Column**: Represents a day of the week or the general tasks area (date, tasks list)
- **Week**: Collection of columns with navigation state (start date, end date)
