title: Spec-first implementation
---
When writing or editing code:
- Treat the latest spec at `specs/**/spec*.md` as source of truth.
- Follow the implementation steps in `specs/**/plan*.md`.
- Implement tasks from `specs/**/tasks*.md`, one task per commit/PR.
- If code and spec disagree, propose a patch to the spec before coding.
- Summarize which tasks were completed in the PR description.
